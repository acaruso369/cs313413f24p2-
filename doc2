1.  list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?
      --> removes the int value 5

 2. list.remove(5); // what does this method do?
        --> removes the value of the element specified

3.  i.remove(); // TODO what happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))?
       In this scenario since it is in a while loop it will remove all values of 77 in
       the list.

4.which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?
  List one: //297 ms --> 10 ; 100 --> 353ms; 1000 --> 804ms; 10000 --> 6s
  List Two performs better as the size increases.
